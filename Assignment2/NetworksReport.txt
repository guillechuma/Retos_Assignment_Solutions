Network Report
By Guillermo Chumaceiro

The networks are formed by the arabidopsis genes defined in ArabidopsisSubNetwork_GeneList.txt,I used the IntAct database to search meaningful interactions between this genes.
The depth of the search is of 3 genes, taking into acount the possibility of intermediary genes not in the list that interact with two genes on the list.
The interactions where filtered by the taxonomy ID of arabidopsis and the quality value of the interaction.
I decided to consider interactions with quality values >= 0.4.
Each network is annotated by the  KEGG pathways and GO terms associated with biological process of the genes of each network.
The following report is a summary of each network and the annotation of the genes in that network.
Keywords:
	I: Indirect gene that interacts (not found on the gene list).
	D: Direct gene that interacts (it is on the gene list).
