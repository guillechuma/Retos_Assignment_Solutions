## Solution to the Assignment 5 of the UPM's Master course in Computational Biology

All the code was written by me (Guillermo Chumaceiro).

This assignment is a jupyter notebook [sparql_queries.ipynb](./sparql_queries.ipynb) that uses SPARQL to answer some biological questions using the Uniprot and MetaNetX SPARQL endpoints.

There are 10 questions and below the question is the SPARQL query with the answers. There is no need to run the notebook because all the answers from the queries are visible.
